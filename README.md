# CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, and Ansible

This README provides an overview of the CI/CD pipeline setup for deploying services on a Kubernetes cluster. The pipeline incorporates Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and other tools to automate AWS infrastructure provisioning, instance configuration, code analysis, and application deployment. Below, you'll find information on the project's structure and how to set up and use this pipeline.

## Project Structure
- **infra/**: This directory contains Terraform files for provisioning AWS infrastructure.
- **ansible/**: Here, you'll find Ansible playbooks for configuring instances.
- **k8s/**: Kubernetes manifests for deploying applications reside here.
- **Jenkinsfile**: Defines the Jenkins pipeline stages and configurations.
- **sonar-project.properties**: Configuration file for SonarQube code analysis.
- **README.md**: You're currently reading it!

## Setting Up the Environment

### Prerequisites
1. An AWS account with necessary IAM permissions for Terraform.
2. An existing Kubernetes cluster set up with Kops.

### Jenkins Configuration
1. Set up a Jenkins instance if not already done.
2. Install the required plugins, such as the AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes plugins.
3. Configure AWS credentials in Jenkins for Terraform and Kops.

### SonarQube Integration
1. Set up a SonarQube server and obtain its credentials.
2. Update the `sonar-project.properties` file with your SonarQube server details.

### Pipeline Configuration
1. In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job.
2. Configure the pipeline to use the `Jenkinsfile` in your project repository.
3. Ensure your Jenkins job environment variables and secrets are correctly configured.

## Using the CI/CD Pipeline

1. Push your code to the source code repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. The Jenkins pipeline will automatically trigger when code changes are pushed.
3. The pipeline will start by provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
4. Once infrastructure is ready, Ansible will configure the instances.
5. SonarQube will analyze the code for quality and issues.
6. Finally, the application will be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Pipeline Customization

You can customize this CI/CD pipeline to suit your specific project needs:

- Modify Terraform files in the `infra/` directory for AWS resource provisioning.
- Adjust Ansible playbooks in the `ansible/` directory for instance configuration.
- Update Kubernetes manifests in the `k8s/` directory for application deployment.
- Extend the Jenkinsfile to add more stages or custom actions.

## Troubleshooting and Support

If you encounter any issues, have questions, or need support, please reach out to the project team or your system administrator for assistance.
